# CodeSprint

For this simple JUCE project, I chose to list my application under the GNU General Public License v.3. This is because the dependancy, being the JUCE framework is under the GNU General Public License v.3. The GPLv3 is a copyleft license, which means that any work derived from the original code must also be distributed under the same license. This way code that is written building off of code under the GPLv3 remains open source. I chose to use the JUCE framework in this case as if I were developing an audio application I would not have to write low level platform specific audio code. The JUCE framework handles building my application as a VST2, VST3, AAX, or Audio Unit plugin. Because I want to develop applications for educational and wide spread use, that takes priority and so GPLv3 is okay for this scenario. The GPLv3 allows users to modify the software and distribute the modified version. However, when distributing modified versions, the source code of the modifications must also be made available under the terms of the GPLv3. So I give up privacy but I am still able to distribute my project.
